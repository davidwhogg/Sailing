year = {1996},
annotate = {A good long read about sailing and physics, with a remarkably romantic prose style (for a physics textbook). The author claims that all the diagrams are based on good data; since the origin of those data are not given, we're suspicious. However, the diagrams are beautiful and many considerations about boat and trim are discussed clearly and usefully. The force model presented by us in \secref{sec:model} in this \documentname\ is given almost exactly in Section~8.4 (HOGG CHECK THIS) of this book and dismissed summarily as not accurate enough for any purpose. There are some discussions of air and water flow around the sail and keel that I am slightly suspicious about, but overall this book is excellent. The content of the book is descriptive and engineering-oriented; it does not include any working physical model of sailing that could be implemented in an introductory physics class to solve problem-set problems about sailing.}

annotate = {A beautiful art-meets-physics book about the design and construction of sails. Chapter~3 of this book has very good diagrams and descriptions of sails in the wind, including examples of hypothetical perfectly planar, flat sails. Those examples make the Chapter a very useful physics reference. It does away with the pure-Bernoulli explanation of lift and instead works in terms of redirection of flow (that is, in our language, momentum transport). This book is only about sails but it is would be a pleasure for any fan of sailing.}

  annotate = {HOGG CHECK THIS: The model for sailing presented in this blog post is very similar in spirit to the model presented by us in \secref{sec:model} and \secref{sec:steady}.
  However the author assumes that there is no drag; that is, (for example) the ratio $A_{\sail}/A_{\above}$ of the quantities used in \eqref{eq:Fsailair} and \eqref{eq:Fhullair} goes to infinity.
  In this limit, sailing can be infinitely fast! But aside from that unreality, the goals of this blogpost are similar to our goals in the sense that it delivers a working, implementable model of sailing.}
